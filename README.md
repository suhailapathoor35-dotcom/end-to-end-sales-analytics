Sales Dashboard Project

Summary

This project showcases a sales dashboard built with Power BI, using cleaned sales data from a CSV file.  The data (in sales.csv) was first cleaned and analyzed with Python, then visualized with Power BI.  The final dashboard displays key sales metrics, including total sales KPIs, sales by region and product, a monthly sales trend, and a list of the top 10 customers by sales.  It provides an interactive view of the businessâ€™s sales performance for easy insight and reporting.

Tools Used

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib): Data cleaning and initial charting.

Power BI Desktop: Final dashboard creation and interactive visuals.

Sales CSV Dataset: Raw sales data (sales perfomance.csv) imported and cleaned.

Full dashboard view showing total sales KPIs, breakdowns by region and product, and other charts.


Line chart displaying monthly sales trend, highlighting seasonal patterns.


Table of the top 10 customers by total sales, ranking major clients.

Key Features

Total Sales KPIs: Summary cards for overall sales, profit, and other key metrics.

Sales by Region & Product: Interactive charts (bar/column) showing how sales break down by region and by product category.

Monthly Sales Trend: A line chart visualizing sales over time to spot trends or seasonality.

Top 10 Customers: Table listing the highest-value customers to focus on major revenue sources.

Interactive Dashboard: Filters and drill-downs allow users to explore data details (e.g., filter by year or region).


Data Preparation Steps

1. Load Data in Python: Read the sales_perfomance .csv file using Pandas.


2. Clean and Transform: Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and formatted dates. Calculated any needed fields (e.g., total sale amount).


3. Initial Analysis: Created basic charts with Matplotlib (for example, sales by product) to validate data and uncover insights.


4. Export Clean Data: Saved the cleaned dataset "sales_cleaned" to a new CSV file for use in Power BI.



How to Open

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.


2. Open the endtoendsaleperfomace.pbix file using Power BI Desktop 


3. The cleaned sales data is embedded in the Power BI file, so no additional setup is needed.

What I Learned

Data Cleaning: I learned the importance of preparing and cleaning raw data (using Python and Pandas) before analysis to ensure accurate results.

Visual Validation: Creating preliminary charts in Python helped me spot data issues and understand trends early on.

Power BI Skills: I gained experience building an interactive dashboard in Power BI, learning how to use visuals, slicers, and KPIs effectively.
